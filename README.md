# ElectroOG
This folder contains the source code for an Android app which plots an electrooculogram and displays blinking history. The Android device gets the essential data from a MyoWare Muscle Sensor via bluetooth, with the help of an Arduino UNO. The accompanying Arduino sketch is located under the directory "Arduino sketch".

This is a university project for our Biomedical Technology class.
